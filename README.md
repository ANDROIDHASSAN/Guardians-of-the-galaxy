# 🚀 Guardians of the galaxy – 3D Near-Earth Object Visualization

Guardinas of the galaxy is an interactive 3D web application that visualizes real-time **Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)** using the official **NASA API**. It simulates these objects moving like real celestial bodies within a realistic solar system. Users can also explore planets and detailed information in an educational and engaging way.

## 🌟 Features

- **🌌 Realistic Solar System:** Visualize all 8 planets in 3D with click-to-learn functionality.
- **☄️ Live NEO Tracking:** Fetches real-time NEO data from NASA and shows them in space like asteroids/comets.
- **📊 NEO Table:** Tabular view of NEO data like name, approach date, size, velocity, and distance.
- **🔭 Planet Lab:** Get info about all planets—distance from the sun, size, number of moons, etc.
- **📘 Intro Section:** Educational section explaining what NEOs are and their significance.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, Three.js
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **API:** NASA NeoWs (Near-Earth Object Web Service)
